# Getting Started

## Requirements

::: warning COMPATIBILITY NOTE
To use Velvet, you need PHP â‰¥ 7.2
:::

Although using Vue's syntax, Velvet does not require any Javascript runtime on server (i.e. Node)

Velvet also has zero dependency, so rest assure from conflicts with other package

[//]: # (This is for the ease of integrate into other framework)

## Some note

::: warning
__Velvet only support **evergreen** browser__
:::

The reason is the lack of transpiler (e.g. babel). So we only serve ES6+ modules to client.
