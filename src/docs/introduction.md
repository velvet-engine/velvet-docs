## Why another PHP Template Engine?

There are a lot of PHP Template Engine: Blade, Twig, Latte and much more. PHP itself is a templating language.
Among them, Twig is clearly the most robust one. Feature-rich, clean syntax and strong-enfoce secure checking.
However, each have its pros and cons. Most of the time, one of the cons is not frontend friendly.

Talking about Vue, the question immediately rise: Isn't Blade already have good support for Vue?
